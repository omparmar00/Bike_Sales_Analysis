# Bike_Sales_Analysis

I recently worked on a bike sales dataste  for Pacific, South America, and Europe regions. The project involved analyzing a dataset containing information about bike owners including their marital status, occupation, age group, and gender.

The goal was to create a dashboard to analyze the bike sales market trends and monitor key indices. I began by cleaning the dataset and then proceeded to read and analyze the data. To create the interactive dashboard, I utilized pivot tables and pivot charts.

In the end, I developed a visually appealing dashboard that provided valuable insights such as the correlation between bike ownership and occupation, the distribution of bike ownership across different age groups, and the gender-wise breakdown of the bike market. This report contained valuable information for making informed decisions
